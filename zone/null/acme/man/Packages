Non-Library Packages and Systems:

    Tadji           A modular command routing tool.  Can use Acme,
                    Concept, and BW commands, as well as arbitrary
                    functions in any object.  Highly configurable.

    Opie            Object Specification Routing System.  Allows tools
                    to use powerful object reference expansion while
                    giving the user the ability to specify a preferred
                    system.  This is used all over the mud.

    ClosureServer   An object which will bind function references and
                    lambda expressions in a harmless environment so
                    that objects can evaluate arbitrary untrusted
                    expressions without putting themselves at risk.

    Sentinel        An object to run various actions based on events.
                    Actions can be an command written to the AcmeCmd
                    specification.  Events are sentinel creation, player
                    logon, reconnect, logout, disconnect, death, killing,
                    and site logon.

    HashServer      Computes one-way hashes and mediate a
                    zero-knowledge proof.  Useful for some security
                    applications.
