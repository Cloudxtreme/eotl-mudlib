# Quine has a bunch of command objects that follow the Acme calling
# protocols, but not the naming conventions.  All the files are named
# things like "reduce_cmd.c" and "think_cmd.c", but we'd want command
# names to be "reduce" and "think".  Even stranger, the functions we
# have to call are named "evaluate_reduce" and "evaluate_think". 
# Don't ask me why.  This person is a real nutcase.  To get the
# command names from the filenames, we use this pattern: %s_cmd.c To
# make the function names from the command names, we use: evaluate_%s
# We put this all together into a config line.  First is the ADD
# directive, then the filespec that matches the command files we
# want, the name pattern, the function pattern, and the calling
# style.  Those commands better be good.
