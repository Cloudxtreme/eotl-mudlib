Tadji Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~

This document will guide you through the steps
which are necessary to begin using Acme's Tadji.

1.  You need to clone the tadji.  You may want to
    put this in your .logon if you want to use it
    everytime you log on:
    
    clone /zone/null/acme/tadji/tool.c
    
2.  The tool comes with two "built in" commands:
    help and tadji.  In order to make use of your
    tadji, you will probably want to configure it
    with other commands.  The tadji can be
    configured manually by using the following
    form of the tadji command:
    
    tadji config <config line>
    
    For example, you might want to add all of
    Zippo's BW commands to your tadji.  Simply
    type:
    
    tadji config BW /usr/zippo/bw/pub/*.c
    
    You might also want to add Zamboni's tadji
    commands:
    
    tadji config ADD /usr/zamboni/cmds/*.c
    
3.  The tadji can also be configured from a
    configuration file.  By default, it looks
    for the file called ~/.tadji.  This file
    simply contains a configuration command on
    each line as in the following example:
    
    ADD /usr/zamboni/cmds/*.c
    BW /usr/zippo/bw/pub/*.c
    BW /usr/esquire/bw/pub/_sitelist.c
    
    You can can configure your tadji from another
    file by using the tadji command:
    
    tadji reset [file]
    
    If you want to change the default config file
    for you tadji, simply:
    
    setv tadji <file>
    
    This file has only covered basic steps to
    configuring and using the tadji.  If you
    want more information about how to configure
    your tadji, see tadji_config.
