NAME
    level_range_fast - faster level_range with side effects
 
SYNOPSIS
    #include <acme.h>
    static inherit AcmeUser;
    #include AcmeUserInc

    object *level_range_fast( object *ulist, int min, int max );
 
DESCRIPTION
    A user-object filter that works on level.  Filters out 
    GetOrdLevel(ulist[i]) < min  or GetOrdLevel(ulist[i]) > max 
    for all in ulist.
 
    Unlike level_range(), this routine screws with the passed
    array rather than just returning a newly constructed version.
    It's probably faster, especailly for lists in which few members
    are kept.
 
EXAMPLE
    level_range( users(), OrdLevel(Guest), OrdLevel(Janitor) )
      would return alist of all wizards online.
 
SEE_ALSO
    level_range(A), wizards(A), mortals(A)
