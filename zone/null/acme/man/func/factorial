NAME
    factorial - calculates factorials
 
SYNOPSIS
    #include <acme.h>
    static inherit AcmeMath;
    #include AcmeMathInc
 
    float factorial( int n );
 
DESCRIPTION
    Returns n!  Note this function returns a float instead of an int.
    This is because it is easy for factorials to get very large very
    fast, and a float won't usually overflow.  Also note that this
    function caches the factorials it calculates, so it's actually
    very fast after the initial factorial has been calculated.
 
EXAMPLE
    factorial( 3 ) -> 6.0
