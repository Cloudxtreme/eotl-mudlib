NAME
    get_dirs - get all the subdirectories of a directory
 
SYNOPSIS
    #include <acme.h>
    inherit AcmeFile;
    #include AcmeFileInc
 
    string *get_dirs( string path );
 
DESCRIPTION
    This function takes an absolute path as an argument and returns
    an array of all the subdirectories in path, including path.
    This array is sorted breadth-first, and returns a list of
    absolute paths.  If you want a depth-first list of the 
    directory tree, just alphabetize the array.
 
NOTES
    Don't use this function on huge directories.  All you'll do is
    lag the mud and probably eval out before you get a return value.
    The function is pretty fast considering what it does, but use
    some common sense.  Anything more than a single /usr or cabal
    dir is probably too much.
 
SEE_ALSO
    get_dir(E), get_files(A)
