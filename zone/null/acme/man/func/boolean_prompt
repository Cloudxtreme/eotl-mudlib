NAME
    boolean_prompt - ask a question and get yes or no input from user
 
SYNOPSIS
    #include <acme.h>
    static inherit AcmeBooleanPrompt;
    #include AcmeBooleanPromptInc

    varargs void boolean_prompt( string question, mixed yesmethod,
                                 mixed nomethod, mixed quitmethod,
                                 int default );
 
DESCRIPTION
    Prints question to this_player(), then prompts for input.  The
    method associated with the player's answer will then be executed.
    Method variables can be in any of the following formats:
      string method             :  call_other( "foo", THISO )
      closure method            :  funcall( method )
      ({ method, extra, ... })  :  method is called as specified above,
                                   and the remaining elements in the 
                                   array are passed as arguments.
    The last argument, default, can be DEFAULT_YES, DEFAULT_NO,
    or DEFAULT_QUIT, and the associated method will be executed by
    default.
 
    It is important that you make the methods return true; if they 
    dont, boolean_prompt assumes they failed and reprints the prompt.
 
EXAMPLE
    void delete_files( string *files )
    {
        boolean_prompt( "You are about to delete " + sizeof( files ) + 
            "files.\nContinue?", ({ "_delete_files", files }),
            "ack_no", 0, DEFAULT_NO );
    }
 
    int ack_no()
    {
        write( "Fine, be that way.\n" );
        return( 1 );
    }
 
    int _delete_files( string *files )
    {   
        map_array( files, #'rm );
        write( "Finis.\n" );
        return( 1 );
    }
   
    Which might output:
  
    You are about to delete 4 files.
    Continue? (yn) [n] y
    Finis.
