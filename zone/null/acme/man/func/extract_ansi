NAME
    extract_ansi - removes and preserves ansi from a string
 
SYNOPSIS
    #include <acme.h>
    static inherit AcmeAnsi;
    #include AcmeAnsiInc

    varargs string extract_ansi( string str, mixed &ansi );
 
DESCRIPTION
    Removes all ansi escape sequences from a string, and returns the
    new string.  An extra optional argument, ansi, may be passed by
    reference to store the ansi that was extracted from str.  Any data 
    in that variable will be destroyed, and the format of the new value 
    will be as follows:
 
      ({ idx1, ansi1, idx2, ansi2, ..., idxn, ansin })
 
    where idx is an integer representing an index in str, and ansi
    is a string holding the value of the ansi that was extracted at
    that index.
    
EXAMPLE
    str = RED "this " BLUE "is " GREEN "a " YELLOW "test." NOR1;
    extract_ansi( str, &ansi );
 
    str -> "this is a test."
    ansi -> ({ 0, RED, 5, BLUE, 8, GREEN, 10, YELLOW, 15, NOR1 })
 
SEE_ALSO
