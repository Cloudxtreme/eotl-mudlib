EXAMPLE
    Let's say you're making a toy that simulates a lightning strike on
    someone.
 
      zap( object targ )
      {
        string myame;
        string tname;
 
        myname = capitalize( THISP->query_name() );
        tname  = capitalize( targ->query_name() );
 
        output( sprintf( "You FRY %s's butt into the dirt!", tname ),
          sprintf( "%s hurls a lightning bolt at %s!", myname, tname ),
          targ,
          "C R A C K!\nA lighting bolt zooms out of the sky and fries you!",
          sprintf( "C R A C K!\nA lighting bolt zooms out of the sky and "
            "fries %s!", tname )
        );
      }
 
      Say Aleron was in a room with Morgaine, Zamboni was in a room with
      Locus, and Aleron used this zap on Zamboni.
 
      Aleron would see:
        "You FRY Zamboni's butt into the dirt!"
 
      Morgaine would see:
        "Aleron hurls a lightning bolt at Zamboni!"
 
      Zamboni would see:
        "C R A C K!
         A lightning bolt zooms out of the sky and fries you!"
 
      and, Locus would see:
        "C R A C K!
         A lightning bolt zooms out of the sky and fries Zamboni!"
