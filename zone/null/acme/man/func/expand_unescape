NAME
   expand_unescape - escapes and interprets escaped characters
 
SYNOPSIS
    #include <acme.h>
    static inherit AcmeStrings;
    #include AcmeStringsInc

    varargs string expand_unescape( string str, string base, int bits );
 
DESCRIPTION
    Takes a string and runs tests against a set of base characters to
    expand escaped characters.  The basestring is in the form 
    "aAbBcC...nN" where "a" is the character to be escaped, and "A" is
    the character it gets expanded to.  Also built into expand_unescape()
    is hex and octal conversion.  The hex expansion character is "x", 
    and the octal expansion will expand if any number from 1 through 7
    is escaped.  If you use "x" is your base string, you will forfeit
    hex expansion.  If you use any of "01234567", you will forfeit octal
    expansion.  base defaults to "a\ab\bt\tn\n".
 
    bits can be used to signal certain action.  The current valid bit
    settings (which can be |'d together) are:
      O_EXPAND_BS_LITERAL     - Keeps backspaces.
      O_NO_EXPAND_HEX         - No hex expansion.
      O_NO_EXPAND_OCTAL       - No octal expansion.
 
EXAMPLE
    expand_unescape("\\n")  ->  "\n"
    expand_unescape("\\A")  ->  "65"              
    expand_unescape("\\x10")[0]  ->  16
    expand_unescape("\\010")[0]  ->  8
