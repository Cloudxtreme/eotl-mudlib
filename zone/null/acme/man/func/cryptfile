NAME
    cryptfile - encrypts or decrypts files

SYNOPSIS
    #include <acme.h>
    static inherit AcmeCrypt;
    #include AcmeCryptInc

    status cryptfile( string infile, string outfile, string key, int type );

DESCRIPTION
    cryptfile() opens and reads the infile, encrypts or decrypts depending
    on the type (using the key) and then writes out to the outfile.  The
    actual crypting is done with crypt().

    Valid type values are:
      ENCRYPT
      DECRYPT


EXAMPLE
      cryptfile( "/usr/aleron/foo.txt", "/usr/aleron/foo.enc", "Zam!SUX3",
          ENCRYPT );

   Will open /usr/aleron/foo.txt encrypt it using "Zam!SUX3" as a key and
   then write it out to "/usr/aleron/foo.enc".  The infile or outfile can
   actually be in a relative format, so we could just as easily been:

      cryptfile( "~/foo.txt", "~/foo.enc", "Zam!SUX3", ENCRYPT );

   Conversely, if we then did a:

      cryptfile( "~/foo.enc", "~/foo2.txt", "Zam!SUX3", DECRYPT );

   foo.txt and foo2.txt would be equivalent.
