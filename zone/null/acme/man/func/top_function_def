NAME
    top_function_def - finds the first declaration of a function in
                       an object
 
SYNOPSIS
    #include <acme.h>
    static inherit AcmeFunction;
    #include AcmeFunctionInc

    string top_function_def( object ob, string func );
 
DESCRIPTION
    Returns the file which declares the function func which would
    get invoked first when trying to call func in ob.  This takes
    shadows and inheritance into account.  This is faster than
    all_function_defs(), so use this if you really only want the
    first declaration.
 
SEE_ALSO
    function_exists(E), all_function_defs(A)
