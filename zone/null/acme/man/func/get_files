NAME
    get_files - recursively get all the files in a directory
 
SYNOPSIS
    #include <acme.h>
    inherit AcmeFile;
    #include AcmeFileInc
 
    string *get_files( string path );
 
DESCRIPTION
    This function takes an absolute path as an argument and returns
    an array of all the files containe in path and path's 
    subdirectories, not including the directories themselves.  This 
    array is sorted breadth-first, and returns a list of absolute 
    paths.  If you want a depth-first list of the directory tree, 
    just alphabetize the array.
 
NOTES
    Don't use this function on huge directories.  All you'll do is
    lag the mud and probably eval out before you get a return value.
    The function is pretty fast considering what it does, but use
    some common sense.  Anything more than a single /usr or cabal
    dir is probably too much.
 
SEE_ALSO
    get_dir(E), get_dirs(A)
