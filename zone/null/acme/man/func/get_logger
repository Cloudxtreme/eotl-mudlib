NAME
    get_logger - request an AcmeLogger instance from AcmeLoggerFactory

SYNOPSIS
    #include <acme.h>

    object logger = AcmeLoggerFactory->get_logger(THISO);
    logger->warn("it's a trick, get an %s", "axe");

DESCRIPTION
    Returns an AcmeLogger instance configured for the specified category.
    The get_logger() function takes one required and three optional 
    arguments:

      object get_logger(string|object category, object rel, int reconfig);

    The category can be any meaningful string, and passing an object will
    result in a category derived from that object's program name. The second
    argument, rel, is an object relative to which the configuration should
    be read. For example, if rel is /usr/devo/workroom, the search for 
    configuration for that category will start at 
    /usr/devo/.logger.properties. If omitted, rel will default to the 
    previous object calling get_logger().

    LoggerFactory will reuse loggers as long as they're actively being used,
    and a loggers config will not change once its created. To re-read the
    config, set the 'reconfig' flag to 1 and a new logger will be created 
    with the current config.
