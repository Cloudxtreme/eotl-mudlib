NAME
    expand_variables - expands variables in a string
 
SYNOPSIS
    #include <acme.h>
    static inherit AcmeStrings;
    #include AcmeStringsInc

    varargs mixed expand_variables( string str, mapping vars, int varchar,
                                    mixed func, mixed args, int kill );
 
DESCRIPTION
    Expands the variables in str.  Variables are designated by a char
    delimiter varchar, or a default of '$'.  The vars mapping has a
    format of:
 
      ([  string var1 : string val1,
          string var2 : closure val2  ])
 
    where the keys are the variables mapped to the values they hold.
    If the value is a closure, it will be funcall'd before being
    entered (allowing for auto-expanding values).
 
    In addition to varchar, there are three more optional variables:
      func  -  a closure or function to handle undefined variables
      args  -  arguments that will be applied along with func
      kill  -  if this is true and we come to a variable we don't know, 
               return with an error code (-1) unless there was a) a func 
               to call and b) the return value was false.
 
EXAMPLE
    expand_variables( "this is a $TEST.", ([ "TEST" : "test" ]) ) ->
      "this is a test."
