AcmeKQML is a package for parsing and constructing KQML messages.
For more information on KQML, see http://www.cs.umbc.edu/kse/

I don't really expect anyone (including me) to use this package.
I only wrote it to see how hard it would be, and possibly as a prototype
for something I'm doing at work.  -Zam
