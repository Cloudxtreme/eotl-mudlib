950712	Aleron & Zamboni
    Cabal created.  Initial directory structure set.  Draft of the manifesto
    written.

950718  Zamboni
    Moved Opie into Acme space.

950726 Zamboni
    Moved ospec into Acme space.
      lib/ospec.c, etc/ospec.help
    Made preliminary inc/acme.h

950731 Zamboni
    Moved in entire personal function library.
/zone/null/acme/lib:
Total 26
   1 acme.h        3 array.c       8 ospec.c     1 string.c 
   3 action.c      2 bw.c          1 room.c      2 varspace.c 
   1 ancestry.c    3 function.c    1 shadow.c 

   Also had minor effects on inc/acme.h and added inc/action.h

   Most of the code has been tested, but isn't well documented.

950802 Zamboni
    Added misc.c to lib/  (ommitted through oversight)
    Also added it to inc/acme.h

950804	Aleron
    Added most of residential's lib functions.  Updated inc/acme.h
Total 40
   1 acme.h        2 bw.c             3 function.c          1 shadow.c 
   3 action.c      4 crypt.c          1 misc.c              1 string.c 
   2 alloc.c       3 cvar.c           8 ospec.c             2 varspace.c 
   1 ancestry.c    1 error.c          1 parse_filename.c 
   3 array.c       2 find_target.c    1 room.c 

950810  Zamboni
    Pulled some more things out of ospec.c, moved my stuff out of
    find_target and into force_load.  Created user.c and file.c.
    Somebody stop me.  ;)
    Also added a bunch of new spiffy filespec handling to ospec.
    Added new things to acme.h, despite it's impending overhaul.
    There are still some issues to be handled with varspace & ospec
    regarding create() not being called on load when it's loaded for
    inheritance reasons.  I have some ideas, but not for tonight.

950816	Aleron
    Coverted all my lib functions over to Acme's Approved Methods :)  Updated
    acme.h

950816  Zamboni
    Ditto, ya bastard.  :)
    Lots of new .h files, fixed the inherits/includes in most (all?) my 
    lib files that have them.
    Added AcmeClosuresInc (inc/closures.h) -- slightly altered version 
    of what Iffy gave us.

950817	Aleron
    Moved home server into acme/home.  now to do the home rooms...

950818  Zamboni
    Tadji now exists in acme/tadji.  I'm very happy with it.  A couple
    things still need to be worked out, but it's pretty slick. 

950825  Zamboni
    Added AcmeArgs - stuff for dealing with arguments nicely.
    Also added a bunch of supporting functions to AcmeStrings and
    AcmeArray.  Docs to follow Real Soon.

950827	Aleron
    Added flatten_array() to AcmeArray.  Updated AcmeArrayInc as well.

950828	Aleron
    Added struct.c lib file.  Has a make_assignptrs() func in it that'll
    generate a flat array of closures that can assign data into
    the input array.  Evil Voodoo.

950829	Aleron
    Added getdata.c lib file.  Now you can get in a standardized manner
    (and even pass in entire arrays of data to get).  More evil voodoo! :)
    Now that I've gotten all the support stuff done, it's back to working
    on HomeCode

951008	Aleron
    Readded flatten_array() to array.c.  We definitely need source control :)

951129	Morgaine
    Wrote a closure_eval_server.c and put it in daemon/.  #def'ed it in
    inc/closures.h

951204	Aleron
    Moved the closureserver defs into acme.h.

951207	Aleron
    Added graph.c lib file.  Currently, it only has a function to check
    graph connectivity.  Added graph.h to inc and editted acme.h.

960104  Zamboni
    Added pronouns to ospec.

960109  Zamboni
    Wrote etc/AcmeLib.README

960111  Zamboni
    Some bugfixes and speedups in ospec.c
    Changed all libraries to use private inheritance.
    Changed all libraries to use <acme.h> instead of "acme.h"

960122 Morgaine
    Added AcmeMath and AcmeMathInc, including from_hex(), from_octal(),
    and a macro definition of pow() in the include.
    I added untabify(), untabify_list(), expand_unescape() and 
    expand_variables() to AcmeStrings.

960124 Zamboni
    Cleaned up VarSpace a bit.  It was a little too well tailored to
    ospec (which was the only thing using it until now), but now it's 
    more general and cleaner.  I also fixed ospec to match the new
    interface.

960127 Zamboni
    Added AcmeCallSecurity - a package for making some basic checks
    of what objects caused a function call for use in security systems.
    It's an imperfect approximation of what THISP really intended to do.

960130 Zamboni
    Added some caching to Opie so it doesn't have to resolve filenames
    into objects, or function names into function pointers over and over.

960202 Zamboni
    Added find_file to AcmeFile and created AcmeMan
    Tweaked expand_path in AcmeFile

960205 Zamboni
    Added AcmeGetOpts - routines for parsing command line options.

960216 Aleron
    Added AcmeConversion - routines to deal with conversions that the mudlib
    doesn't handle.

960229 Zamboni
    OSpec assumes neuter gender for nonliving objects

960229 Zamboni
    Added mortals() and wizards() to AcmeUser

960305 Zamboni
    Added a '==ob' and 'u'-as-filter to OSpec.  Nothing too exciting.

960314 Zamboni
    In AcmeArgs, replaced match_enclosure() with find_close_char().

960314b Morgaine
    Added remove_ansi() to AcmeStrings and the IsAlpha() macro to
    AcmeStringsInc, mainly for remove_ansi() support.

960319 Zamboni
    Added array_eq() and array_equal() to AcmeArray.

960319 Zamboni
    Added nesting capability to AcmeOSpec.

960321 Aleron
    Created AcmeSentinel and put it in daemon/sentinel/*.

960322 Zamboni
    Added resolve_filespec() and find_targets() to AcmeFindTarget.

960325 Aleron
    Added indent() and center() to AcmeStrings.

960325 Zamboni
    Added priority argument to AcmeOSpec and Opie.

960326 Zamboni
    Added #include AcmeFindTargetInc  to  AcmeCommandInc
    (re?)added trim_left() and trim_right() to AcmeStrings.
    Fixed minor bug in AcmeArgs->find_close_char().  It failed on ("").

960327 Aleron
    Added man/func.  From now on, we'll put all function man pages in there,
    and all package man pages in man/pkg.  I inagurated the func directory
    with a man/func/get_data :)

960328 Zamboni
    AcmeGetOpts: removed getopts_str() and inheritance of AcmeArgs.
    Added getopts_long().

960328 Aleron
    Created man/func docs for all lib functions that I own :)
   1 array2D2map             1 cryptfile               1 indent
   1 array2map               1 error                   1 make_assignptrs
   1 calloc                  2 exit_menu               2 menu_choice
   1 center                  1 flatten_array           1 old_choose_variant
   3 check_connectivity      4 get_data                2 output
   1 choose_variant          2 get_data.example        2 prev_menu
   1 crypt                   1 ialloc                  2 print_menu

960401 Zamboni
    Added #define SEC_MANAGE   "security management" 
    to AcmeCallsecInc

960401 Zamboni
    In AcmeStrings, changed base_string from a private global var 
    to a #define.  Also documented some functions.

960401 Aleron
    Added AcmeStack and AcmeQueue.  AcmeStack has new(), empty(), push(),
    pop(), and top().  AcmeQueue has new(), emtpy(), enqueue(), dequeue(),
    and front().

960402 Zamboni
    Added the tadji command `tsec`.  It revealed a hole in the tadji's
    security system caused by AcmeVarSpace (inherited by AcmeCallSecurity,
    inherited by the tadji) interacting poorly with VariableCode 
    (inherited by ObjectCode, inherited by the tadji).  I fixed it by
    adding vset and vquery to AcmeVarSpace and changing AcmeCallSecurity
    to use those.  Pretty gross, but it all works now.  Unfortunately, that 
    isn't a general solution.  CallSecurity can be made to quietly fail
    when integrated with other packages.  I don't know any way to fix it.

960403 Aleron
    Broke out the method-handling code in AcmeGetData and made it a package
    in its own right (AcmeMethod).  Modified GetData to use it.

960403 Zamboni
    Moved Opie documentation and examples to man/pkg.
    Copied/extracted documentation from CallSecurity to man/pkg.
    Changed all efun calls in CallSecurity to efun::<whatever> to 
    avoid the possibility of overloading.

960404 Morgaine
    Zamboni, program_name() is a simul_efun, so efun::program_name() in
    AcmeCallSecurity keeps it from loading.  I fixed it.

960425 Zamboni
    Created AcmeKQML for no good reason.

960426 Zamboni
    Added AcmeKQML->pack() for worse reasons.

960514 Zamboni
    Created AcmeHashServer (daemon/hash.c).

960516 Zamboni
    Changed hash algorithm in the hash server to be 32 random bits.

960808 Zamboni
    Installed new version of AcmeOspec.  It's a big rewrite, based on 
    a completely different parsing strategy.  It's much easier to
    inherit and configure for personal preferences.  I don't know how the
    speed compares.

960813 Zamboni
    Added sorting capabilities to AcmeOspec.

960814 Zamboni
    Fixed AcmeStrings->searcha_str_unescaped().  It was relying on
    index/searcha to do some things, which is faster, but index/searcha
    doesn't support step size for some reason, so now it just does it
    all itself.

    Also fixed bug in same function and in searcha_any() which would have
    caused an infinite loop when a negative stepsize was used.  (duh)

960814 Zamboni
    Added support in AcmeOSpect for function arguments in lfuns for 
    mapping, filtering, and sorting.

960823 Aleron
    Rewrote AcmeOutput to be cleaner.  (what can I say?  it was really old
    code)

960905 Aleron
    Wrote aexplode() to work the way the real explode() should, and added it
    to the AcmeStrings package.

960920 Zamboni
    Switched CallSecurity over to the new locking system.  Changed
    documentation, headers, library, the tadji, the sentinel, and several
    other minor things.


970114 Zamboni
    Removed use of pad() from AcmeStrings.

970120 Zamboni
    Changed index() to searcha() in AcmeStrings, AcmeKQML, AcmeOSpec, 
    AcmeGraph, and AcmeAction.

970315 Zamboni
    Put Everything in AcmeLib (/lib/acme) and AcmeInc (/inc/acme)
    under FCS.

970318 Zamboni
    Added 'brief' flag to AcmeMisc->format_objects() and print_objects()

970422 Aleron
    Added ACME_METHOD_ERROR to AcmeMethod, and changed run_method() so that
    it'll return the error if an error occurs while running the method, and
    otherwise, it'll just return whatever the method returns.

970422 Aleron
    Added AcmeBreadth to do breadth first searches and traversals on trees
    and graphs.

970423 Aleron
    Added function docs AcmeBreadth package, breadth_first func, and examples.

970520 Morgaine
    I made some of the defines of the previous AcmeMenu library functions that
    can be overloaded to give a menu generated thereby a different feel than
    default.

970813 Zamboni
    Fixed two small bugs in tadji/cmds/tsec.c
    Added tadji/cmds/tsec.README
    Added AcmeVarspace->vspace()
    Added AcmeCallSec->sec_oplist()
    Added `tsec list operations` to tadji/cmds/tsec.c
    Changed AcmeFile->file_exists() to use conform to published interface
    in MASTEROBJECT (rather than using ACCESSOBJECT).
    Removed the "all" security category from the tadji.  (The maintanance
    gain was minimal, and the speed and security complexity overhead
    was nontrivial.)
    Put tadji/tadji.c and tadji/tool.c under FCS.

970923 Zamboni
    Added the mapfile feature to AcmeOSpec.

971124 Zamboni
    Added initialize_ok() to tadji/tadji.c (moving the test out of create()
    so subclasses could override it).

971208 Devo
    Added multiple-use option stuff to AcmeGetOpts.

971218 Devo
    Added "l" transformation to ospec.c.

971231 Devo
    Added anti_searcha_any() to array.c.

971231 Devo
    Added to_int_range() to array.c.

980105 Zamboni
    Fixed bug in $MANPATH handling in AcmeMan.

980109 Devo
    Added get_dirs() and get_files() to file.c.
    Added munge_dirname() to strings.c.
    Added typecast_array(), sum_array(), mean_array(), median_array(),
      mode_array() to array.c.
    Added not_random() to misc.c.
    Added find_inherit() to find_target.c.

980120 Devo
    Removed not_random() from misc.c and added random_array() to array.c

980120 Zamboni
    Tweaked random_array() a bit to make it marginally faster.

980120 Devo
    Added unique_array_slow() to array.c

980123 Devo
    Added sort_alist() to array.c.

980124 Devo
   Added round() to math.c.

980123 Devo
    Added AcmeStat and AcmeStatInc, a statistics package.  Removed
    mean_array(), sum_array(), mode_array(), and median_array()
    because they are now in the AcmeStat package.

980318 Aleron
    Broke homecode back out of the AcmeDirs and back into the (reinstated)
    Residential cabal.  Practicing to be a manager (if last year we
    centralized, this year we decentralize...and vice versa).

980403 Aleron
    Changed AcmeMenu to use AcmeStack (instead of the hokey ad hoc way it was
    doing before).  Also changed AcmeMenu to handle previous menus properly
    now.  Finally, noticed that the man pages for new, new1, empty and empty1,
    were incorrect, and so updated them to newqueue, newstack, emptyqueue, and
    emptystack, respectively.

980428
    Added factorial() and factorial_vector() to AcmeMath.
980528
    Fixed a bug in tadji/tool.c that gave config access to any
    object with query access, through pointer manipulation.
