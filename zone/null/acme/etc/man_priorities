Here's a priority list for documentation:

Non-Library Packages and Systems:

    Opie            Object Specification Routing System.  Allows tools
                    to use powerful object reference expansion while
                    giving the user the ability to specify a preferred
                    system.  This is used all over the mud.

    ClosureServer   An object which will bind function references and
                    lambda expressions in a harmless environment so
                    that objects can evaluate arbitrary untrusted
                    expressions without putting themselves at risk.


Libraries

  Core Routines
      String          String handling
      File            Files handling
      Array           Array handling
      Shadow          Shadow handling

  User Interfaces
      Menu            A package to create a standardized menuing system.
      GetData         A standardized set of methods to get input from a user
      Args            Argument parsing
      GetOpts         Routines for handling command line options

  More complex things
      CallSecurity    A basic extensible security system 
      Error           Error reporting
      ForceLoad       Force objects to be loaded
      CVar            Chooses among various weighted options
      Graph           Graph algorithms package
      VarSpace        A two-tiered mapping ( A 2-D VariableCode )

The order of those libraries within each category is arbitrary.  Feel
free to reorder them.  The order of the categories had a little thought
behind it.
