                            ACME Manifesto

               "Anything you can do, we can do better."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Statement of Direction:

  We reject the aesthetic of the past, of the running-dog anarchistic
  manner in which resources have been squandered in the past.  We
  reject the modernists, _and_ the post-modernists.  Unlike the
  modernists, we feel that the past does indeed have value.  It
  provides us with the experience to avoid the mistakes of our
  predecessors.  We also reject the ideology of the post-modernist.
  There is no hyperreal.  Bauilldriard is incorrect.  The simulation
  has _not_ become more real than the real (unless you're some
  acne-covered, taped-eyeglass-wearin' geekoid who's lost sight of
  reality).

  In this post-post-modernist environment (which we refer to as
  ACMEism) the primary focus of our aesthetic will be quality.
  Efficiency is desired, but Elegance is paramount.

  Given the chaotic state of life, the universe, and everything, we
  feel that in order to realize the goals of ACMEism it will be
  necessary for us to completely control all resources in order to
  utilize them to their full potential.  We will begin here on EOTL,
  the bastion of the post-modernists; the environment of simulation;
  the finest attempt at the Bauillriard's hyperreal that we have seen.
  The next step is control of the United States, and then later the
  world.

  We will accomplish this by supplanting the obsolete tools of the
  past.  No longer will we allow our resources to be wasted by
  inelegant, inefficent so-called "tools."  No longer will we hold
  ourselves to antiquated notions of half-hearted integration.  We 
  begin by providing a varied and useful library base that will have
  clean, elegant interfaces, and can be easily integrated into other
  code.  We will continue with lucid documentation of all public
  library interface functions and we will end with innovative
  user-level tools that will demonstrate the features of, and the
  potential services provided by, the library.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Production Goals:

  A varied and useful library base that has clean, elegant, intuitive
  interfaces and can be easily integrated into other code.

  Lucid documentation of all public library interface functions.

  Innovative user-level tools that demonstrate the features of and
  potential services provided by the library.


Process Goals:

  The primary focus of our efforts is on quality.  Efficiency is
  desired, but elegance is paramount.

Motivation:

  Given the chaotic state of life the universe and everything, it is
  necessary to completely control all resources in order to utilize
  them to their full potential.

  It is our intent to completely dominate all life and resources in
  the universe, starting with EOTL.
