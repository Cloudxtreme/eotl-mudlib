  Acme 25:17  

    The path of the righteous coder is beset on all sides by the
    inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of unenlightened
    programmers.  Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
    will, shepherds legacy code through the valley of darkness, for he
    is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost resources. 
    And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious
    anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.  And
    you will know my name is Acme when I lay my vengeance upon you.
